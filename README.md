# A Merged Multi-Level Convolutional Network with Homogeneous Filter Capsules

This repository contains the code used for the experiments detailed in a forthcoming paper. The paper will be available pre-published at arXiv very soon.

## Required Libraries
-   TensorFlow (see  [http://www.tensorflow.org](http://www.tensorflow.org/))
-   NumPy (see  [http://www.numpy.org/](http://www.numpy.org/))
-   OpenCV if using the `--log_annotated_images` parameter (see [python/training](python/training) and see [http://opencv.org/](http://opencv.org/))
-   At least one GPU

## Reproducing the Results

Coming soon...
